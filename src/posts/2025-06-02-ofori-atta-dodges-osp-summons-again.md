Former Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Atta has reportedly failed to appear before the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP) for the second time, citing undisclosed health concerns. His lawyer, Frank Davies, confirmed the absence, claiming his client was medically unfit to attend the scheduled interrogation on June 2.  

The OSP had summoned Ofori-Atta as part of an ongoing corruption probe into alleged financial misconduct during his tenure. This latest no-show has fueled speculation about whether the ex-minister is genuinely ill or strategically evading accountability.  

Davies insists the health issues are legitimate but provided no further details, leaving critics skeptical. Meanwhile, the OSP has yet to announce whether it will reschedule the questioning or pursue alternative measures to compel Ofori-Atta’s cooperation.  

Public reaction has been divided, with some sympathizing with the former minister’s health struggles while others accuse him of playing the system. As pressure mounts, questions linger: Is this a genuine medical setback or a well-timed delay tactic?
